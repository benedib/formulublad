This is the source code for Formúlublað Fjölbrautaskólans í Garðabæ, compiled by the mathematics department. Work started in 2007, and we have been slowly adding, removing and improving it ever since.

The formulur.etex should be regarded as the real true source of this project, that file is then transformed to formulur.tex which in turn is transformed to formulur.pdf - the finished product.

Use eukleides (http://www.eukleides.org) to transform formulur.etex to formulur.tex (hint: use the texforme shell script) - or if you do not have eukleides installed on your computer you can cheat, and just run the tekform shell script).

Enjoy!
